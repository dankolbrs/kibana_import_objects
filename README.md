# Kibana Objects Import

Imports Kibana visualizations, searches, and dashboards to be used by others or migrated.

1. Clone this repo in your ES environment
2. Export relevant dashboard, visualizations, searches via Kibana UI
3. Save them in the json file and/or folder desired
4. Customize elk.cnf folder for location of exports (file name and location)
5. run python import_objects.py

You should then see that it imports all of the ojects specified.  This was written to be a part of a bigger script.  But can still be used and customized as needed.

**More to add.  Still WIP**
